Save ISS with Astrobee!!!

Event Information

1.1. Purpose of Kibo-RPC
The Kibo Robot Programming Challenge (Kibo-RPC) is an educational program in which
students solve various problems by programming free-flying robots (Astrobee and Int-Ball) in
the International Space Station (ISS). It is hoped that, by providing these students with the
opportunity to work with professional scientists and engineers, they will be inspired to develop their own educational and professional goals to a high level.
Participants will have the chance to learn cutting-edge methodologies and to hone their
skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics through this program. The KiboRPC will also expand international exchange by encouraging students to interact with other
participants from around the world.
This program is hosted by the Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) in cooperation with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

1.2. Educational Objective for 1st Kibo-RPC
Engineering teaches us that a simulation can only approximate the real world. Thus, participants are expected to learn techniques for creating simulation programs that perform well
in the real world despite uncertainties and within margins of error.
Students will learn the necessity of controlling and correcting positions and orientation of a
free-flying robot and how to perform assigned tasks in the onboard environment through simulation trials.
